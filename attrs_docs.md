# Valid `attrs` dictionaries

Both **`DownloadStats`** and **`ConstructURL`** can take a **dictionary-typed keyword argument** named `attrs` to help **filter the match data returned by a query**. This dictionary's documentation merits its own page because Tennis Abstract doesn't have a public API and its structure is liable to change at any moment.

## `attrs` may contain any or all of the following keys and values:

### `'start date'` : *pandas.Timestamp or datetime.datetime*
- Limit query to matches on or after the given date. **If you use this key, you must also use `'end_date'`**.
